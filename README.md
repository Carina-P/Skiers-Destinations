## UX
<!--
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.

## Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to build rudimentary wireframes for a basic understanding.
I have made frames for desktop, tablet and mobile:
- [Wireframe for Desktop](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations/blob/master/wireframes/wireframe-desktop.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Tablet](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations/blob/master/wireframes/wirefram-tablet.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Mobile](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations/blob/master/wireframes/wireframe-mobile.pdf)

### Major changes compared to above wireframes

## Design Choices
### Fonts
I have choosen **Oswald**, because i find it very **useful** on different platforms, **clean** and **easy** to read. "Oswald is designed 
to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices." (quote from 
[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald#standard-styles). 
And as the alternative font: Open Sans.
