## UX
<!--
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to build rudimentary 
wireframes for a basic understanding. I have made frames for desktop, tablet 
and mobile:
- [Wireframe for Desktop](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations/blob/master/wireframes/wireframe-desktop.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Tablet](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations/blob/master/wireframes/wirefram-tablet.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Mobile](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations/blob/master/wireframes/wireframe-mobile.pdf)

### Major changes compared to above wireframes

## Design Choices
### Fonts
I have choosen **Oswald**, because i find it very **useful** on different 
platforms, **clean** and **easy** to read. "Oswald is designed 
to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, 
laptops and mobile devices." (quote from 
[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald#standard-styles). 
And as the alternative font: Open Sans.

### Icons

### Colors
I want the colors to match a day in the skiing slope: White for **snow**, 
light-blue for the **sky** and yellow for the **sun**. 
<img src="wireframes/colors-skiers-destinations.png" width="75%">

- **Text** to contrast lighter backgrounds: **Raisin black** #262730
- **Main background** and if background is dark: **White** #ffffff
- **Framing** as borders: **Columbia blue** #cae9ff
- Details to **stick out** as buttons: **Sunglow** #fecf3e

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, 
and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, 
provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it 
was used.

## Testing
When it has been feasible the test where automated. The rest was tested 
manually. 
The manually testing was performed **regularly** in a **iterative** manner 
during the development of the site and then **thorough** after all features 
was in place. Testing often  and after a small part of development, makes it is 
**easier to find** and **fix bugs early** and it is also a way to 
**use experience** in coming development.

When all features was implemented the following tests was performed:
- Validated by [W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Validated by [W3s CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- According to the **scenarios** as described below
- The **deployed version** was tested
<!--In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
-->
### Scenarios
### Validation with W3S
### Some of the bugs
CORS: There is a CORS-problem when fetching information from Weather Unlocked. 
Code Institute support looked at the problem but could not understand how to 
solve it. But they said I should use jQuery Ajax for my requests instead of 
fetch, since it seems to be working better with the API and the problem appears 
a little less frequently. And this is why I use fetch when fetching information 
from local file and JQuery ajax when fetching information from Weahter Unlockeds 
API. The bug appears in that way that you do not get any information for one or 
more of the resorts (The InfoWindow in map is still showing but not the text 
beside/under the map).

## Deployment 
Skiers Destinations was developed on GitPod [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/), using git and GitHub to host the repository. The code was pushed
to GitHub Pages.
 
When deploying Skiers Destinations using GitHub Pages the following steps were made:

* Opened up **[GitHub](https://github.com/** in the browser and signed in. 
* Navigated to [Skier Destinations repository](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Destinations)
* In the top navigation selected **'Settings'**.
* Scrolled down the Settings page until the **"GitHub Pages"** area was located. 
* Under "Source", the dropdown showing **"None"** was selected and then **'Master Branch'** was chosen.
* The selection was saved and the page automatically refreshened. And the published site is found by **scrolling back down the "Settings" again** to "GitHub Pages". Where it says **"Your site is published at.."**

Here is the live site: [Skiers Destinations](https://carina-p.github.io/Skiers-Destinations/)

<!--
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
